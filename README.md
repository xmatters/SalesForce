# SalesForce Service
Transform customer relationships, and your business, using the latest in mobile and data technology to deliver the most personalized customer experience ever — every time, and anywhere. This document instructs how to setup an integration between xMatters and SalesForce Case Management.  When a case is created, SalesForce reaches into xMatters to figure out who is on call for assignment of the case.

# Pre-Requisites
* SalesForce Case Module
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files
* [xMattersAlert.tgr](xMattersAlert.tgr.js) - The trigger used after a Case is initially submitted.  It sets the tokens/fields of the case that will be passed into xMatters and calls the xMatters request function.
* [xMattersreq.cls](xMattersreq.cls) - This is the Apex class that executes the Restful Post call into xMatters.
* [SalesForce.zip](SalesForce.zip) - The comm plan (if needed) that has all the cool scripts and email format and such. 

# How it works
Add some info here detailing the overall architecture and how the integration works. I.e. An action happens in Application XYZ which triggers the thingamajig to fire a REST API call to the xMatters Inbound Integration. The integration script then parses out the payload and builds an event and passes that to xMatters. 

# Installation
Details of the installation go here. 

## Application ABC set up
Specific steps go here

## xMatters set up
1. Create a new Shared Library or (In|Out)bound integration
2. Add this code here:
   ```
   var items = [];
   items.push( { "stuff": "value"} );
   console.log( 'Do stuff' );
   ```
   
# Testing
Be specific. What should happen to make sure this code works? What would a user expect to see?

# Troubleshooting
Optional section for how to troubleshoot. Especially anything in the source application that an xMatters developer might not know about.
